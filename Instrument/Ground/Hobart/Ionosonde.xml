      <Description>The Hobart Ionosonde station near Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, has ionosondes since December 1945. The first is an analog ionosonde with nitrate film from 12/1945 to 11/1951. Between 09/11/1951 and 01/06/1977, there was an ionosonde with 35mm film. According to SWS archived Hobart scaled ionospheric data book, At least between 90/1970 and 12/1970 the ionosonde was IPS 3D. Between 02/06/1977 and 20/12/1996, there was an ionosonde with 16mm film in operation. According to SWS archived Weelkly Station Summary, there was an IPS 4B at least from 17/03/1982 and an IPS 3E in the year of 1982 too. There was an IPS 4D between 28/02/1994 and 15/09/2001, IPS 5A between 09/01/1991 and 17/04/1997, CADI between 14/10/1998 and 16/02/2009, IPS 5D since 24/09/1998 to now. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.
